Jason implementation of an autonomous BDI agent to play Hanabi, that combines Theory of Mind and abductive reasoning.

[comment]: <> (when I have a pre-print or something similar, write the short introduction to the repo)

## Usage

In order to run the MAS of agents playing Hanabi, it is necessary to have a working installation of [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/).

To start the MAS, navigate to the hanabdi root folder on your terminal and run:

```{bash}
jason hanabdi.mas2j
```
